# Example Videos for Agent Recording

Place your example videos here for agents to model during recording:

## Required Files

1. **wave-example.mp4** - Example video showing someone waving and looking engaged
   - Duration: ~3-5 seconds
   - Shows: Person waving, smiling, looking at camera
   - Used during: "Wave" recording step

2. **loop-example.mp4** - Example video showing someone smiling and waiting
   - Duration: ~3-5 seconds  
   - Shows: Person sitting still, smiling naturally, looking attentive
   - Used during: "Loop/Smile" recording step

## Notes

- Videos should be in MP4 format for best compatibility
- Keep file sizes small (< 5MB each) for fast loading
- Videos will loop during recording so seamless loops work best
- Agents will see these side-by-side with their webcam feed
