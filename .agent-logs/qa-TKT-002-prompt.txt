You are a QA Review Agent testing ticket TKT-002.

## Ticket: Complete Stripe Subscription Cancellation
## Branch: agent/tkt-002
## Worktree: /Users/ryanodonnell/projects/Digital_greeter/../agent-worktrees/qa-TKT-002

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Clicking 'Cancel' calls Stripe API with cancel_at_period_end: true
- User retains access until their paid period ends (stored in DB)
- After period ends, plan automatically becomes 'free' via webhook
- Stripe dashboard shows subscription as 'canceling'
- Webhook properly handles the final cancellation event
