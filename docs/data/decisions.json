Check email to activate your account\"\n- Dashboard access only after verification\n\n**Option C: Full Access, Later Lockout**\n- Full access for 7 days unverified\n- After 7 days, block access until verified\n- Risk: Some users never verify\n\n**My take:** Option A gives best of both worlds - conversions stay high, and you gate risky actions.
