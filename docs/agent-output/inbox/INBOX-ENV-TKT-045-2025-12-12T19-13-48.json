    "merge_commits": [
      "c9d3f01 - Merge TKT-045: Exclude dismissed surveys from PMF calculation - QA Passed",

  "root_cause": "Ticket tracking not updated after merge. Dispatcher assigned agent to ticket that was already completed.",

  "human_actions_required": [
    "1. Verify merge commits (c9d3f01, 33af288) contain correct implementation",
    "2. Update ticket status in tickets.json to 'merged' or 'completed'",
    "3. Clean up agent worktree for tkt-045 if it still exists",
    "4. Investigate dispatcher logic - why was completed ticket assigned?",
    "5. Archive blocker file to docs/agent-output/archive/"
  ],

  "impact": "Low - work was already done, just wasted 30min of agent time",

  "questions_for_pm": [
    "Should we add a pre-flight check to prevent assignment of merged tickets?",
    "Is there a ticket status field that should have been updated post-merge?"
