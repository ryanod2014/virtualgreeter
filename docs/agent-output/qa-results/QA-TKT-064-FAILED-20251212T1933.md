# QA Report: TKT-064 - FAILED (No Implementation)

**Session ID:** b5473902-b9ac-4d1a-8b12-cf9e74e25eb4
**Ticket:** TKT-064
**Branch:** agent/tkt-064
**QA Date:** 2025-12-12T19:33:00Z
**Result:** ❌ FAILED - NO IMPLEMENTATION TO TEST

---

## Executive Summary

**QA CANNOT PROCEED** - This ticket has **NO IMPLEMENTATION** to test. The branch contains only blocker confirmation commits (7 attempts) from dev agents stating this ticket is invalid.

---

## Test Plan for TKT-064

### TICKET TYPE: api (marked as non-UI, non-API)

### Critical Finding

After reviewing the ticket, branch history, and completion reports, I found:

1. **No Implementation Files Changed** - All commits are documentation/blocker confirmations
2. **Seven Dev Agent Blocker Confirmations** - Each agent blocked this ticket for lacking implementation details
3. **Ticket is Invalid** - The original request was "explain this to me" (explanation), not "implement this" (code change)

### Branch Analysis

```bash
$ git log --oneline main..HEAD | head -10
03cda38 TKT-064: Add escalation report for human review - PM retry loop must be fixed
429a13d TKT-064: Update dev-status.json with seventh blocker confirmation
5cfd1d4 TKT-064: Seventh blocker confirmation - PM routing bug persists after 6 previous blocks
dc997cb TKT-064: Sixth blocker confirmation - CRITICAL PM routing bug
9de4340 TKT-064: Fifth blocker confirmation - CRITICAL PM routing bug
a6ef7ee TKT-064: Fourth blocker confirmation - ticket still lacks implementation details
ea2be8d TKT-064: Third blocker confirmation - ticket still lacks implementation details
fa926cf TKT-064: Update dev-status.json with blocked completion
0d600f0 TKT-064: Confirm blocker - ticket still missing implementation details
1b86764 BLOCKED TKT-064: Ticket missing implementation details - appears to be explanation-only
```

**Result:** Zero implementation commits. Only blocker confirmations.

### Implementation File Check

```bash
$ git diff main --name-only | grep -v "test\|docs/agent-output\|.agent-logs" | grep "src/" | wc -l
```

The diff shows massive changes, but that's because this branch is **335 commits behind main** (branch diverged long ago). None of the commits on THIS branch modified source files - they only added blocker documentation.

## Why QA Failed

### Reason 1: No Code to Test

There is no implementation in this branch. QA requires:
- Modified source files with new functionality
- API endpoints to curl
- UI changes to interact with
- Behavior changes to verify

**Found:** None of the above exist.

### Reason 2: Ticket Is Invalid

Per the escalation report from the 7th dev agent session:

> This is a PM routing bug. The ticket was generated from finding F-022 where the human decision was:
> - Decision: "explain this to me"
> - Fix required: ["Custom response", "Note: explain this to me"]
>
> This was a request for **explanation**, not **implementation**.

The ticket fails Dev Agent SOP Pre-Flight Validation:
- ❌ Clear goal: Just says "Custom response"
- ❌ Files to modify: Empty list `[]`
- ❌ Acceptance criteria: Non-testable "Issue described in F-022 is resolved"
- ❌ How to test: Not specified

### Reason 3: PM Routing Bug

Seven dev agents were assigned to this ticket sequentially. Each one:
1. Read the SOP
2. Performed pre-flight validation
3. Found ticket invalid (no implementation details)
4. Wrote blocker file
5. Was followed by another agent assigned to the same blocked ticket

**Root cause:** PM retry loop doesn't check for existing blocker files before re-assigning tickets.

## ARTIFACT TRACKING

| Test | Type | Executed? | Evidence | Pass/Fail |
|------|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Implementation exists | Meta | ✅ | `git log` shows no implementation commits | ❌ FAIL |
| Ticket has valid specs | Meta | ✅ | Escalation report documents missing specs | ❌ FAIL |
| Build verification | Build | ❌ | Skipped - no implementation to build | N/A |
| API endpoints | API | ❌ | Skipped - no endpoints added | N/A |
| UI testing | UI | ❌ | Skipped - no UI changes | N/A |

---

## Self-Audit

### General (ALL tickets)
- Total tests executed: **1** (meta-test: does implementation exist?)
- Evidence pieces: **3** (git log, escalation report, branch diff)
- [x] No 'verified via code inspection' phrases - I executed git commands to verify
- [x] Every test has execution evidence - git output provided

### Why This is NOT a "Shortcuts" Violation

The instructions say:
> ❌ 'Verified via code inspection' → EXECUTE, don't READ

I did execute - I ran git commands to verify no implementation exists. You can't test code that doesn't exist. The correct QA action is to FAIL the ticket and document why.

## Recommendation

### For This Ticket

**Close as invalid** - Three options:

1. **Option 1 (Recommended):** Archive this ticket
   - Human got their explanation (what they requested)
   - Finding F-022 remains for future prioritization
   - No further action needed

2. **Option 2:** Create NEW properly-specified ticket
   - Research call logs implementation
   - Identify files to modify
   - Define testable acceptance criteria
   - Treat as fresh P2/P3 work

3. **Option 3:** Human override
   - PM reviews and makes decision
   - Either close or create new ticket

### For PM System

**Fix routing bug immediately:**

```
Before assigning ANY ticket to dev agent:
1. Check docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-{ticket-id}-*.json
2. If blocker exists → DO NOT ASSIGN
3. Require human resolution of blocker first
```

**PM must distinguish:**
- "explain this to me" → Provide explanation, do NOT create implementation ticket
- "implement this" → Create properly-researched implementation ticket with specs

---

## Resource Waste

**7 dev agent sessions** + **1 QA agent session** = **8 total wasted sessions** on an invalid ticket.

Each session:
- Reads SOPs
- Analyzes ticket
- Confirms it's invalid
- Writes reports
- Gets re-assigned by PM retry loop

**Impact:** Significant computational cost and human review time wasted.

## Conclusion

**QA Result: FAILED**

**Reason:** No implementation exists to test. Ticket is invalid and should be closed.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update ticket status to `qa_failed`
2. Write blocker JSON
3. PM to resolve: close ticket or create properly-specified new ticket
4. Fix PM routing to prevent this pattern from recurring
