**Key Facts:**
- Documentation file was already corrected and merged to main
- This branch contains only prompt/tracking files (no source code changes)
- Zero production risk (documentation-only ticket)
- No services to start, no API calls to test

---

## Test Environment

**Testing Type:** Documentation Verification (file inspection)
**Files Verified:** `docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md` on main branch
**Tools Used:** grep, sed, head, git diff
**Branch Status:** 1 commit ahead of main (prompt file only, no source changes)

---

## Test Plan Execution

### Test 1: Title Verification
**Objective:** Verify file title accurately describes feature
**Method:** Extract first line of documentation file
**Command:** `head -1 docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`

**Expected:** Title should be "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting (V6)"

**Actual Result:**
```
# Feature: Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting (V6)
```

**Evidence:** Line 1 of docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Title accurately describes the feature without misleading terminology

---

### Test 2: "Visitor" Reference Audit
**Objective:** Ensure "visitor" only appears in clarifying/exclusion context
**Method:** Search entire file for "visitor" (case-insensitive)
**Command:** `grep -i -C 2 'visitor' docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`

**Expected:** Word "visitor" should only appear to clarify they DON'T have access

**Actual Result:**
```
Line 13: > **Authentication Required:** This feature is only accessible to
         authenticated dashboard users (Agents, Admins, Platform Admins).
         Website visitors do not interact with this feature directly.
```

**Evidence:** Only 1 occurrence found (line 13), used correctly to EXCLUDE visitors

**Result:** ✅ PASS - "Visitor" appears once in clarifying context: "Website visitors do NOT interact with this feature directly"

---

### Test 3: "Post-Call" Reference Check
**Objective:** Ensure no misleading post-call feedback references
**Method:** Search for "post-call" or "post call" patterns
**Command:** `grep -i -E 'post[-\s]?call' docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`

**Expected:** Zero occurrences

**Actual Result:**
```
No matches found
```

**Evidence:** grep returned no matches

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Zero references to post-call feedback

---

### Test 4: Authentication Requirements Clarity
**Objective:** Verify authentication requirements are stated in multiple places
**Method:** Search for "authentication" and "authenticated" throughout file
**Command:** `grep -i -C 1 'authentication\|authenticated' docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`

**Expected:** Multiple clear statements that authentication is required

**Actual Results:**

1. **Line 4 (Quick Summary):**
   ```
   A cross-organization feature request voting system and private bug reporting tool
   for authenticated dashboard users.
   ```

2. **Line 6 (Naming Note):**
   ```
   > **Naming Note:** The term "public" in the original feature name referred to
   cross-organization visibility of feature requests (visible to all authenticated users,
   regardless of organization), NOT anonymous/unauthenticated public access.
   This feature requires authentication.
   ```

3. **Line 13 (Authentication Required Callout):**
   ```
   > **Authentication Required:** This feature is only accessible to authenticated
   dashboard users (Agents, Admins, Platform Admins). Website visitors do not
   interact with this feature directly.
   ```

4. **Line 20 (Purpose Section):**
   ```
   Provides a two-part feedback system for authenticated dashboard users
   (Agents, Admins, Platform Admins):
   ```

5. **Line 21 (Feature Requests Description):**
   ```
   A Reddit-style voting forum where authenticated users from ANY organization
   can submit, vote on, and discuss feature ideas.
   ```

6. **Line 267 (Security Section):**
   ```
   | Feature request spam | Requires authentication |
   ```

**Evidence:** 6 separate locations mentioning authentication requirements

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Authentication requirements clearly stated in:
- Quick summary
- Naming note with explicit "requires authentication"
- Dedicated callout block
- Purpose section
- Feature description
- Security considerations

---

### Test 5: "Public" Terminology Clarification
**Objective:** Verify "public" is explained as cross-org, not anonymous
**Method:** Extract naming note that clarifies terminology
**Command:** `sed -n '6,7p' docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`

**Expected:** Explicit clarification that "public" ≠ anonymous access

**Actual Result:**
```
> **Naming Note:** The term "public" in the original feature name referred to
cross-organization visibility of feature requests (visible to all authenticated users,
regardless of organization), NOT anonymous/unauthenticated public access.
This feature requires authentication.
```

**Evidence:** Lines 6-7 contain dedicated naming note

**Result:** ✅ PASS - "Public" terminology is explicitly clarified with:
- What it DOES mean: cross-organization visibility
- What it does NOT mean: anonymous/unauthenticated access
- Explicit statement: "This feature requires authentication"

---

### Test 6: Feature Description Accuracy
**Objective:** Verify feature is accurately described as voting/bug reporting
**Method:** Read Purpose section describing functionality
**Command:** `sed -n '19,23p' docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`

**Expected:** Feature described as:
1. Voting/feature request system
2. Bug reporting with attachments
3. For authenticated users only

**Actual Result:**
```
### Purpose
Provides a two-part feedback system for authenticated dashboard users (Agents, Admins, Platform Admins):
1. **Feature Requests (Cross-Organization):** A Reddit-style voting forum where authenticated users from ANY organization can submit, vote on, and discuss feature ideas. Requests are visible across all organizations, enabling community-driven feature prioritization. Top-voted features inform product roadmap.
2. **Bug Reports (Organization-Private):** An in-app bug reporting tool with screenshot/recording capture, visible only within the submitter's organization for internal tracking.
```

**Evidence:** Lines 19-23 (Purpose section)

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Feature accurately described as:
- Two-part feedback system
- Feature request voting forum (cross-organization)
- Bug reporting with attachments (organization-private)
- Explicitly for "authenticated dashboard users"
- Clear distinction between public feature requests and private bug reports

---

## Source Code Change Verification

**Objective:** Confirm no source code changes (documentation-only ticket)
**Method:** Git diff excluding docs directories
**Command:** `git diff main...agent/tkt-007-v2-v2 -- ':!docs/agent-output' ':!docs/prompts' ':!docs/data'`

**Expected:** Zero lines of diff (no source changes)

**Actual Result:**
```
0 lines of changes
```

**Evidence:** `git diff | wc -l` returned 0

**Result:** ✅ VERIFIED - Zero source code changes, confirming documentation-only ticket

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### Original Issue (from completion report)
The documentation had a misleading name/description suggesting post-call visitor feedback, when it's actually a feature request voting and bug reporting system for authenticated dashboard users.

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Feature doc accurately describes voting/feedback system | ✅ VERIFIED | Lines 19-23 describe two-part system: voting + bug reporting |
| No mention of 'visitors' or 'post-call' in misleading context | ✅ VERIFIED | "visitor" appears once (line 13) to EXCLUDE them; zero "post-call" references |
| Clear that authentication is required | ✅ VERIFIED | Stated in 6 different locations throughout document |
| "Public" terminology clarified | ✅ VERIFIED | Lines 6-7 contain dedicated naming note explaining cross-org vs anonymous |
| Title reflects actual feature | ✅ VERIFIED | "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting (V6)" |

**All acceptance criteria met.**

---

## Risk Assessment

**Production Risk:** None
- Documentation-only change
- No code modifications
- No database migrations
- No API changes
- No UI changes

**Documentation Risk:** Low
- Corrections accurately reflect actual feature behavior

---

## Additional Observations

### Documentation Quality
The corrected documentation is **comprehensive and well-structured**:
- Clear naming note addressing terminology confusion
- Multiple authentication callouts for emphasis
- Detailed feature descriptions with code references
- Complete edge case analysis
- State machine diagrams
- Security considerations documented

### Continuation Ticket Context
Per the dev completion report, this continuation was triggered by a false-positive regression test failure (shell script syntax error, not actual code issues). The documentation work was already complete on main branch. This QA verifies the work is correct.

### Pre-Existing Issues Found by Dev Agent
Dev agent reported pre-existing build issues (merge conflicts, TypeScript errors) that are unrelated to this ticket. These were documented in findings files but do not affect this documentation-only ticket.
