# QA Report: TKT-034 - FAILED ❌

**Ticket:** TKT-034 - Call Logs Pagination for Performance
**Branch:** agent/tkt-034
**Tested:** 2025-12-14T05:00:00Z
**Session ID:** a185b2ce-2dee-4c27-9960-baebac647b37

## Summary

QA testing was blocked due to infrastructure issues. The dashboard application fails to start due to module resolution errors, preventing any functional testing of the pagination feature.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| AC1: API accepts page and limit parameters | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot test - dashboard won't start |
| AC2: Default page size is 50 | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot test - dashboard won't start |
| AC3: UI shows pagination controls | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot test - dashboard won't start |
| AC4: Filters work correctly with pagination | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot test - dashboard won't start |

## Testing Attempted

### Build & Environment Setup
- ✅ Successfully installed dependencies
- ✅ Started dashboard on port 3134
- ❌ Dashboard fails with module resolution error

### Error Details
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@ghost-greeter/domain'
  24 | import { TIMING } from "@ghost-greeter/domain";
  25 | import type { AgentProfile, User } from "@ghost-greeter/domain/database.types";

Import trace:
./src/features/signaling/signaling-provider.tsx
./src/features/signaling/app-shell.tsx
```

### Code Review (What I Could Verify)

Based on git history and completion reports:

1. **Files Modified for Pagination:**
   - `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/calls/page.tsx` - Admin calls page
   - `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/calls/calls-client.tsx` - Admin calls client component
   - `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/dashboard/calls/page.tsx` - Agent calls page
   - `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/dashboard/calls/agent-calls-client.tsx` - Agent calls client component

2. **Implementation Notes from Previous Completion Reports:**
   - Pagination parameters (`page` and `limit`) are handled in searchParams
   - Default limit is set to 50 items per page
   - Pagination UI includes Previous/Next buttons
   - Filters are preserved across page navigation
   - Page resets to 1 when filters change

## Blocker Details

**Blocker Type:** Infrastructure
**Blocker File:** `docs/agent-output/blocked/QA-TKT-034-FAILED-20251214T0500.json`

The `@ghost-greeter/domain` package exists in the workspace but isn't being resolved correctly by the build system. This prevents:
- Running the development server
- Accessing any pages for testing
- Verifying pagination functionality

## Recommendation

This ticket should be requeued for QA testing after the module resolution issue is fixed. The pagination implementation appears to be complete based on code commits and previous completion reports, but cannot be verified without a working application.

## Next Steps

1. Fix module resolution issues in the build system
2. Ensure all workspace packages are properly linked
3. Re-run QA testing once the application can start successfully
