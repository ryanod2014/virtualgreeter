# QA Review: TKT-008

**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Ticket:** TKT-008 - Fix Uptime Monitoring Doc - Use Free Tier Settings
**Branch:** agent/tkt-008
**Tested:** 2025-12-06
**Reviewer:** QA Agent

## Summary

This ticket successfully updates the uptime monitoring documentation to consistently use 3-minute check intervals, which aligns with Better Uptime's free tier limitations. All acceptance criteria have been met.

## Build Verification

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| pnpm install | ✅ PASS | Dependencies installed successfully |
| pnpm typecheck | ⚠️ PRE-EXISTING ISSUES | Type errors in test files (widget package), unrelated to doc changes |
| pnpm build | ⚠️ PRE-EXISTING ISSUES | Build errors in test files (server package), unrelated to doc changes |
| pnpm test | ⏳ RUNNING | Tests running (not blocking for doc-only changes) |

**Note:** The typecheck and build failures are pre-existing issues in test files (widget and server packages) and are NOT related to this documentation-only ticket. These failures exist in test code and do not affect the documentation changes made in TKT-008.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Criterion 1: All monitor configs show 3-minute check frequency

**Verified:** All monitoring configurations consistently specify 3-minute intervals:

- **Table Summary** (lines 23-28): All 4 services show "3 min"
  - Dashboard: 3 min
  - Signaling Server: 3 min
  - Supabase API: 3 min
  - Widget CDN: 3 min

- **Monitor Configurations:**
  - Monitor 1 (Dashboard): `Check Frequency: 3 minutes` (line 70)
  - Monitor 2 (Signaling Server): `Check Frequency: 3 minutes` (line 89)
  - Monitor 3 (WebSocket): `Check Frequency: 3 minutes` (line 121)
  - Monitor 4 (Supabase API): `Check Frequency: 3 minutes` (line 133)
  - Monitor 5 (Widget): `Check Frequency: 3 minutes` (line 150)

### ✅ Criterion 2: Doc clearly states this is the free tier limit

**Verified:** Multiple clear statements throughout the document:

- Line 30: "All monitors use 3-minute check frequency, which is the free tier limit. Upgrading to 1-minute checks costs $20/mo."
- Line 37: "Free tier: 10 monitors, 3-minute intervals, unlimited alerts"
- Line 81: "3-minute check frequency is the free tier limit."
- Line 103: "3-minute check frequency is the free tier limit."
- Line 125: "3-minute check frequency is the free tier limit. If Better Uptime doesn't support WebSocket monitors on free tier, skip this and rely on the HTTP health check."
- Line 321: "3-minute check frequency ✅"
- Line 330: "1-minute checks on all monitors | $20/mo" (upgrade cost clearly stated)

### ✅ Criterion 3: No contradictions between tier description and config

**Verified:** Complete consistency throughout the document:

- **Free tier description** states "3-minute intervals"
- **All monitor configs** specify "3 minutes" or "3 min"
- **Cost analysis section** correctly identifies 3-minute frequency as free tier feature
- **Upgrade section** clearly states 1-minute checks require $20/mo upgrade
- No instances of conflicting frequencies (no 1-minute, 5-minute, etc.)

## Changes Made

**File Modified:** `docs/features/monitoring/UPTIME_MONITORING.md`

The documentation has been updated to:
- Standardize all monitoring check frequencies to 3 minutes
- Add explicit notes that 3-minute intervals are the free tier limit
- Include upgrade cost information ($20/mo for 1-minute checks)
- Maintain consistency between the summary table, individual monitor configs, and cost analysis sections

## Regression Analysis

**Impact:** Documentation only - no code changes

- ✅ No functional code changes
- ✅ No API changes
- ✅ No database schema changes
- ✅ No configuration changes
- ✅ No dependencies changed

## Recommendation

**✅ APPROVE FOR MERGE**

This ticket successfully achieves its goal of fixing inconsistencies in the uptime monitoring documentation. All acceptance criteria are met, and the documentation now clearly and consistently reflects Better Uptime's free tier limitations.

The pre-existing test failures in the widget and server packages are unrelated to this documentation change and should be addressed in separate tickets focused on code quality improvements.
