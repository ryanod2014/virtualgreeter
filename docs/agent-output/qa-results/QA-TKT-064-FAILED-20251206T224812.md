# QA Review: TKT-064

**Status:** ❌ FAILED
**Ticket:** TKT-064 - URL Filter is Client-Side Only
**Branch:** agent/tkt-064
**Tested:** 2025-12-06T22:48:12

## Executive Summary

This ticket FAILED QA, but not due to implementation bugs. The dev agent correctly identified that TKT-064 lacks implementation specifications and blocked development before any code was written. The branch contains no implementation changes, only a blocker file documenting the issue.

## Build Verification

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| pnpm install | ✅ PASS | Dependencies installed successfully |
| pnpm typecheck | ❌ FAIL | 42 TypeScript errors in widget package |
| pnpm build | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No point building with typecheck failures |
| pnpm test | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No code changes to test |

**Note on TypeCheck Failures:** The 42 TypeScript errors are pre-existing test type errors in the widget package (test mocking issues, undefined checks, etc.). These are unrelated to TKT-064 since this branch contains no code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ❌ Issue described in F-022 is resolved

**Status:** NOT ATTEMPTED
**Reason:** The ticket was never implemented. The dev agent stopped at pre-flight validation.

### ❌ Change is tested and verified

**Status:** NOT APPLICABLE
**Reason:** No changes were made to test or verify.

## Root Cause Analysis

The dev agent identified that TKT-064 violates SOP section 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation requirements:

1. **No Files to Modify:** The ticket specifies `files: []` - no code files identified
2. **No Implementation Steps:** The `fix_required` field contains only:
   - "Custom response"
   - "Note: explain this to me"
3. **Untestable Acceptance Criteria:** "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" cannot be tested without knowing what implementation to verify

## Why This Ticket Exists

TKT-064 was generated from finding F-022, which identified that URL filtering in call logs is client-side only (limited to ~500 fetched records). However, when this finding was reviewed, the human's decision was "explain this to me" - a request for explanation, not implementation.

The system mistakenly created an implementation ticket from an explanation request.

## Finding F-022 Details

**Issue:** URL filtering in dashboard call logs only filters the client-side displayed data (limited to whatever has been fetched, typically ~500 calls), not the full dataset on the server.

**Suggested Fix:** Move URL filtering to server-side query (related to F-021 pagination implementation).

**Human Decision:** "explain this to me" (custom response requesting explanation, not implementation)

## Recommendation

**Action:** CLOSE THIS TICKET AS INVALID

**Reasoning:**
1. The dev agent correctly blocked this ticket per SOP requirements
2. No code changes were made (appropriate given the missing spec)
3. Finding F-022 describes a real issue that may warrant future implementation
4. However, THIS ticket cannot be implemented as-is

**If Implementation is Desired:**
A new ticket should be created with proper specifications:
- Identify specific files in dashboard call logs (likely in `apps/dashboard/src/features/call-logs/`)
- Define server-side API changes needed
- Specify frontend query parameter implementation
- Provide testable acceptance criteria (e.g., "User can filter calls by URL, results include matches from full dataset beyond 500-record fetch limit")
- Consider coordination with F-021 (pagination) implementation

## Files Changed

```bash
# No implementation files changed
# Only blocker documentation:
docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-TKT-064-2025-12-06T0230.json
```

## Conclusion

This is a **process failure, not a code failure**. The ticket generation process created an invalid ticket from an explanation request. The dev agent correctly identified and blocked it. No merge should be attempted.

**Verdict:** Close ticket, optionally create new properly-specified ticket if URL filtering implementation is desired.
