## Review Details

### What Was Changed (TKT-008)
The ticket addressed a contradiction where the doc mentioned using Better Uptime's free tier (3-minute checks) but configured monitors with 1-minute checks (paid tier).

### Verification Results

| Acceptance Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---------------------|--------|----------|
| All monitor configs show 3-minute check frequency | ✅ PASS | Lines 70, 89, 126, 138, 155 all specify "Check Frequency: 3 minutes" |
| Doc clearly states this is the free tier limit | ✅ PASS | Notes added at lines 30, 81, 103, 130 explicitly state "3-minute check frequency is the free tier limit" |
| No contradictions between tier description and config | ✅ PASS | All references consistent; 1-minute only mentioned as paid upgrade option |
