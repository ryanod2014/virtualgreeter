- **Ticket:** TKT-007

## Summary

TKT-007 was a documentation-only ticket to fix the public feedback feature documentation. The work has already been completed in previous sessions and the changes have been merged to main.

### Original Changes Made

The following documentation was already updated as part of the ticket implementation:

- **File:** `docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated title to "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting (V6)"
  - Added clarifying note about "public" meaning cross-organization visibility, not anonymous access
  - Removed misleading references to "visitors" in the context of feedback
  - Added explicit "Authentication Required" section
  - Clarified that this feature is for authenticated dashboard users only

### Mode 2 Assessment

Since TKT-007 was a documentation-only ticket and the documentation has already been properly updated with the 10-section format, no additional documentation changes are needed. The feature documentation now accurately describes the system as a feature request voting and bug reporting tool for authenticated users.
