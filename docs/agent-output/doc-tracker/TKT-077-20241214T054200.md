## Changes Summary

Updated the Pool Management documentation to reflect TKT-077 improvements:

1. **Edge Case Updates**: Modified scenario #10 to show that attempting to add routing rules to catch-all pools now displays a user-friendly alert message instead of a silent warning. Added scenarios #14 and #15 to cover update operations and database trigger defense.

2. **Error Handling**: Added two new error states documenting the user-friendly error messages shown when attempting to add/modify routing rules on catch-all pools, including handling of database trigger errors.

3. **Function Documentation**: Added documentation for `handleAddRoutingRule` and `handleUpdateRoutingRule` functions, noting their catch-all validation behavior implemented in TKT-077.

4. **Code References**: Added line references for the two routing rule handler functions with their updated line numbers.
