## Summary of Changes

Updated documentation to reflect the secure recording storage implementation from TKT-015:

1. **Video Recordings Documentation (`video-recordings.md`):**
   - Documented the new randomized UUID storage pattern replacing predictable paths
   - Added comprehensive details about signed URL generation with 1-hour expiration
   - Documented the RecordingPlayer component with auto-refresh at 45 minutes
   - Updated data flows to show server-side upload via `/api/recordings/upload`
   - Added new edge cases for signed URL expiration and security scenarios
   - Enhanced security section with new mitigations

2. **Recording Settings Documentation (`recording-settings.md`):**
   - Updated upload flow to reference the new API endpoint
   - Modified storage path pattern to show UUID generation
   - Enhanced security section with signed URL and UUID details
   - Updated bucket description to emphasize private storage

Both documents now accurately reflect the security improvements implemented in TKT-015, ensuring future developers understand the secure recording architecture.
