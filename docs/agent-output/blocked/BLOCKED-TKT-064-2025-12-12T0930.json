  "issue": "TKT-064 continues to fail SOP section 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation. This ticket has been blocked 6 times already with the same issue. The ticket was generated from finding F-022 where the human decision was 'explain this to me' - a request for explanation, NOT implementation. The ticket contains: (1) Empty files list, (2) 'Custom response' as the only fix requirement, (3) Non-testable acceptance criteria. This is a PM ROUTING BUG - explanation-only tickets should not be routed to dev agents. The human has already received their explanation via the decision system.",

  "options": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "label": "Mark ticket as INVALID and close — The human requested an explanation (which was provided), not implementation. Finding F-022 can remain in findings for future prioritization if the human later decides to implement server-side URL filtering.",

    {
      "id": 2,
      "label": "Convert to proper implementation ticket — If the human NOW wants implementation (not just explanation), generate a NEW ticket with proper specs: files to modify (dashboard query/API code), server-side filtering approach, testable acceptance criteria. This would require PM investigation and codebase research.",

      "label": "Continue blocking — Keep this ticket blocked waiting for PM to fix the routing bug and either close the ticket or convert it to a proper implementation spec.",

  ],

  "recommendation": "Option 1 because after 7 blockers and multiple commits confirming the same issue, it's clear this ticket should never have been routed to a dev agent. The human got their explanation through the decision system. If implementation is desired later, that requires a NEW ticket with proper research and specifications.",
