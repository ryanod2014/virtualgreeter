  "issue": "TKT-064 was generated from finding F-022, but the human decision was 'explain this to me' (a custom response requesting explanation). The ticket's fix_required field contains ['Custom response', 'Note: explain this to me'] which is not an implementation specification. The ticket has no files to modify (files: []), no specific implementation requirements, and acceptance criteria that cannot be tested ('Issue described in F-022 is resolved'). According to the SOP section 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation, this ticket is missing: (1) specific file paths to modify, (2) clear implementation steps in fix_required, and (3) testable acceptance criteria. This appears to be a ticket generation error - the human wanted an explanation of the finding, not implementation work.",

  "recommendation": "Option 1 because the finding describes a real issue (URL filtering limited to 500 calls). The explanation was given, but if the human wants it fixed, we need proper implementation details. A PM agent should research the call logs feature, identify affected files, and generate a proper dev ticket with specific implementation steps.",

The suggested fix in F-022 is to 'Move URL filtering to server-side query'. If implementation is desired, need to: (1) locate call logs query/filter code in dashboard, (2) understand current client-side filtering implementation, (3) design server-side query parameter, (4) update both backend API and frontend to support URL query param. This is likely related to F-021 (pagination) as mentioned in the decision system response."
