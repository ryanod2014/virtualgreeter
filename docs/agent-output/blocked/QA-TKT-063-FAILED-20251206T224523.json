      "error": "The ticket specification (dev-agent-TKT-063-v1.md) contains a critical mismatch: The 'issue' field correctly describes cache TTL optimization from Finding F-001, but the 'fix_required' field incorrectly states 'Implement strict sanitization (mask ALL sensitive fields)' which is completely unrelated. The 'Files to Modify' section says '(see ticket for files)' but provides no actual files. Acceptance criteria references F-001 but provides no specific measurable criteria."

  "recommendation": "Ticket TKT-063 requires PM clarification before any implementation can proceed. The specification needs to be corrected with: (1) Fix the 'fix_required' field to match the actual issue (cache TTL analysis, not sanitization), (2) Specify which approach to take (add monitoring, make TTL configurable, or document trade-offs only), (3) Provide specific files to modify, (4) Define measurable acceptance criteria. The dev agent's blocker JSON (BLOCKED-TKT-063-2025-12-06T0922.json) recommends Option 3 (documentation-only) as the most appropriate approach.",
