  "category": "bug",
  "severity": "high",
  "file": "apps/dashboard/src/features/workbench/workbench-client.tsx",
  "line": 38,
  "issue": "Dashboard package has multiple pre-existing TypeScript errors that prevent `pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck` from passing. The most critical is in workbench-client.tsx where RecordingSettings is missing required properties (rna_timeout_seconds, max_call_duration_minutes). There are also 100+ test file errors in pools-client.test.tsx related to missing 'theme' property in WidgetSettings.",
  "suggestion": "Fix the RecordingSettings type in workbench-client.tsx by adding the missing properties. Consider fixing test type errors in pools-client.test.tsx as well. These errors block CI/CD and make it impossible to verify that new code changes don't introduce type errors.",
