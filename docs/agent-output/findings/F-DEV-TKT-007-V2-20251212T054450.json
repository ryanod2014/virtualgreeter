  "issue": "Multiple merge conflict markers found in apps/server/src preventing builds:\n- socket-handlers.ts (lines 641-667): conflicts between HEAD, origin/agent/tkt-005e, and origin/agent/tkt-004d-paused-org-status\n- socket-handlers.test.ts (line 438)\n- organization.test.ts (lines 67, 412)\n- geolocation.ts (multiple locations)\n\nThese conflicts appear to be from incomplete merges of branches tkt-005e and tkt-004d-paused-org-status. The conflicts prevent pnpm build from succeeding.",
  "suggestion": "Human engineer needs to resolve merge conflicts by:\n1. Reviewing the conflicting changes from both branches\n2. Deciding which implementation to keep or how to merge them\n3. Removing all conflict markers (<<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>>)\n4. Testing the resolved code\n5. Committing the resolution",
