  "issue": "Build fails due to unused imports and variables in test files: 'afterEach' in pool-manager.test.ts:1, 'CallRequest' and 'ActiveCall' in socket-handlers.test.ts:437, 'TIMING' in socket-handlers.test.ts:438. These are TypeScript errors (TS6133, TS6196) that prevent successful build completion.",
  "suggestion": "Remove unused imports and variables from test files, or add eslint-disable comments if they're needed for future test cases. Quick fix: Remove lines with unused declarations or prefix variables with underscore (_afterEach, _CallRequest, etc.) to indicate intentional non-use.",
