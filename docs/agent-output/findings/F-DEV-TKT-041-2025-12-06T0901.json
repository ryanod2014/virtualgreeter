  "issue": "The useState initialization for RecordingSettings is missing required properties 'rna_timeout_seconds' and 'max_call_duration_minutes'. This causes the build to fail with a TypeScript error. This is a pre-existing issue not introduced by TKT-041.",
  "suggestion": "Add the missing required properties to the initial state object: rna_timeout_seconds (likely 30 or similar default) and max_call_duration_minutes (likely 60 or similar default). Check the RecordingSettings type definition to see what the appropriate default values should be.",
