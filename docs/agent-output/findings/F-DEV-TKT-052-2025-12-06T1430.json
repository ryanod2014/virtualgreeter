  "issue": "Dashboard build fails due to pre-existing type error in workbench-client.tsx line 38. The RecordingSettings type requires rna_timeout_seconds and max_call_duration_minutes fields, but the initial state object doesn't include them. Additionally, there are numerous pre-existing type errors in test files across widget, dashboard, and server packages that were introduced by recent test-lock commits.",
  "suggestion": "Fix the workbench-client.tsx type error by adding the missing required fields to the initial state: rna_timeout_seconds: 300 (or appropriate default) and max_call_duration_minutes: 60 (or appropriate default). For the test file errors, either fix the type issues or update tsconfig to exclude test files from build-time type checking.",
