  "issue": "The dashboard package has pre-existing TypeScript errors that cause `pnpm typecheck` to fail at the monorepo level. Errors include: 1) Stripe null checks in route.test.ts (stripe is possibly null), 2) RecordingSettings type mismatch in workbench-client.tsx (missing rna_timeout_seconds and max_call_duration_minutes properties). These errors existed before TKT-001 changes.",
  "suggestion": "Fix the TypeScript errors: 1) Add null checks for stripe variable in billing tests, 2) Update default RecordingSettings to include all required properties",
