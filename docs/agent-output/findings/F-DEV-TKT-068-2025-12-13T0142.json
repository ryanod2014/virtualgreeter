  "issue": "The ticket specifies files_to_modify that don't exist: 'apps/server/src/features/pageviews/track.ts' and 'database/migrations/XXXX-make-agent-id-nullable.sql'. The actual implementation uses 'apps/server/src/lib/pageview-logger.ts' and 'supabase/migrations/20251128400000_widget_pageviews.sql'. All acceptance criteria are already met by the existing implementation, making this ticket appear to be either outdated or incorrectly scoped.",
  "suggestion": "Update ticket generation process to verify file paths exist before creating tickets, or add a pre-flight check that warns when specified files don't exist. For this specific ticket, either: (1) Close as already implemented, or (2) Update with correct file paths if additional work is needed.",
