  "issue": "Multiple TypeScript errors in dashboard billing test files where 'stripe' is possibly 'null'. Also, workbench-client.tsx has type error with RecordingSettings missing required properties (rna_timeout_seconds, max_call_duration_minutes). These errors prevent 'pnpm typecheck' from passing at the monorepo level, though individual package typechecks may pass.",
  "suggestion": "Add null checks or type guards for stripe in test files. Update RecordingSettings interface usage in workbench-client.tsx to include the missing required properties. Consider running typecheck in CI to catch these issues earlier.",
