  "file": "multiple files",
  "issue": "Multiple files in the codebase contain unresolved merge conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) that prevent TypeScript compilation. This blocks the standard 'pnpm typecheck' command from passing, which is required for verifying new code changes. The conflicts affect apps/server, apps/dashboard, and apps/widget packages.",
  "suggestion": "Resolve merge conflicts in the following files:\n- apps/server/src/features/signaling/socket-handlers.ts (lines 641-667)\n- apps/server/src/features/signaling/socket-handlers.test.ts (line 438+)\n- apps/server/src/lib/organization.test.ts (lines 67, 412)\n- apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/pools/pools-client.tsx (lines 1562-1583)\n- apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/platform/feedback/page.tsx (lines 37-43)\n- apps/dashboard/src/features/cobrowse/CobrowseViewer.tsx (lines 120-261)\n- apps/dashboard/src/features/surveys/ellis-survey-modal.tsx (lines 136-140)\n- apps/widget/src/features/webrtc/useWebRTC.test.ts (lines 1067, 1456)\n\nThese appear to be leftover conflicts from previous merges that were not properly resolved. A human engineer should review each conflict and choose the correct resolution.",
