  "severity": "medium",
  "file": "apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/admin-layout-client.test.tsx",
  "line": 140,
  "issue": "Multiple test files have type errors where mock objects don't include all required properties from updated type definitions. This affects: admin-layout-client.test.tsx (user props), workbench-client.test.tsx (agentProfile props), and apps/widget test files (Window type casting). These are pre-existing errors not related to TKT-020 changes.",
  "suggestion": "Update test mock objects to include all required properties from the current type definitions, or use type assertions/partial mocks appropriately. Consider reviewing all test files after type definition updates to keep mocks in sync.",
