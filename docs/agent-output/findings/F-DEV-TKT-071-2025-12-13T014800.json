  "issue": "Build fails due to unresolved merge conflict markers in three files: socket-handlers.ts (lines 641-667 has <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= markers from tkt-004d, tkt-005e merges), socket-handlers.test.ts (lines 438-441 has conflict from tkt-062 merge), and organization.test.ts (line 67 has invalid backtick character causing TS1127 error). These conflicts are pre-existing from previous merges and were not fully resolved. The previous TKT-071 agent cleaned up geolocation.ts (commit c3e67f8) but missed these files.",
  "suggestion": "Manually resolve the merge conflicts by: (1) In socket-handlers.ts: Choose the correct version of the canAgentGoAvailable vs isOrgPaused logic around lines 641-667, (2) In socket-handlers.test.ts: Keep or remove the TIMING import at line 439, (3) In organization.test.ts: Fix the template literal at line 67 - appears to have wrong character encoding for backticks",
