  "issue": "Server build fails due to unused variable errors in test files: 'afterEach' is declared but never used (pool-manager.test.ts:1), and 'CallRequest', 'ActiveCall', 'TIMING' are declared but never used (socket-handlers.test.ts:437-438). These are pre-existing errors from main branch, not introduced by TKT-018.",
