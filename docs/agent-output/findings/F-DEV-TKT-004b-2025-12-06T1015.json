  "issue": "The server package has multiple pre-existing TypeScript errors that prevent `pnpm build` from passing. These include: missing '@ghost-greeter/domain' module declarations, unused variable warnings, type mismatches in test files, and implicit 'any' types. These errors existed before TKT-004b changes and are not caused by the auto-resume scheduler implementation.",
  "suggestion": "Run a dedicated ticket to fix all TypeScript errors in the server package. Consider adding a CI check that blocks PRs with type errors. The errors are primarily in: pool-manager.ts, redis-pool-manager.ts, socket-handlers.ts, redis-socket-handlers.ts, and various test files.",
