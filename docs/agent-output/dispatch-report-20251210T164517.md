# Dispatch Agent Report

**Run:** 2025-12-10T16:45:17
**Session Type:** Blocker Processing (Task 1)

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **ALL CLEAR** - No blockers requiring processing at this time.

The dispatch agent has completed a comprehensive scan of the workflow system and found:
- **0 blockers** in the blocked folder (ready to process)
- **0 entries** in the re-queue file (waiting on tooling)
- **335 pending decision threads** in the PM Dashboard database
- **0 items** in the inbox folder

---

## Task 1: Process Blockers ✅ COMPLETE

### Blockers Scanned
- **Location:** `docs/agent-output/blocked/`
- **Files Found:** 0 (only .gitkeep)
- **Status:** No blockers to process

### Blocker Types Checked
| Type | Count | Action Taken |
|------|-------|--------------|
| QA-*-FAILED-* (QA failures) | 0 | N/A |
| QA-*-TOOLING-* (Missing tooling) | 0 | N/A |
| CI-TKT-* (CI failures) | 0 | N/A |
| REGRESSION-TKT-* (Regression) | 0 | N/A |
| BLOCKED-TKT-* (Clarification) | 0 | N/A |
| ENV-TKT-* (Environment) | 0 | N/A |
| EXT-TKT-* (External setup) | 0 | N/A |

---

## Task 5: Re-queue Check ✅ COMPLETE

### Re-queue Status
- **Location:** `docs/data/requeue.json`
- **Entries Waiting:** 0
- **Status:** No tickets blocked on tooling improvements

The re-queue file is initialized and ready for future tooling blockers.

---

## Decision Threads Analysis

### Pending Threads Detected
- **Total Pending:** 335 decision threads
- **API Status:** ✅ PM Dashboard responding at http://localhost:3456
- **Thread Range:** F-001 through F-778

**Note:** These decision threads are awaiting human review/triage. They were likely created by a Triage Agent and need human decisions before tickets can be created. This is **normal workflow state** and not a blocker for the Dispatch Agent.

### Sample Pending Threads
Representative sample of findings awaiting decisions:
- F-778, F-777, F-776, F-775, F-774, F-773, F-772, F-771, F-770...
- (335 total threads spanning from recent findings)

**Recommended Action:** Human should review pending decision threads via PM Dashboard UI or trigger a decision processing workflow.

---

## Archive Status

### Inbox Folder
- **Location:** `docs/agent-output/inbox/`
- **Items:** 0 (plus screenshots folder)
- **Status:** No human-escalated items pending

---

## System Health Checks

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Blocked Folder | ✅ Clear | No blockers to process |
| Re-queue File | ✅ Initialized | Ready for future entries |
| PM Dashboard API | ✅ Online | Responding at :3456 |
| Decision Threads | ⚠️ 335 Pending | Awaiting human review |
| Inbox | ✅ Clear | No escalated items |

---

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Read Dispatch Agent SOP
2. ✅ Scanned `docs/agent-output/blocked/` folder
3. ✅ Verified re-queue.json exists and is initialized
4. ✅ Checked PM Dashboard API for pending threads
5. ✅ Verified inbox folder status
6. ✅ Generated this dispatch report

---

## Actions Required

### Immediate Actions: NONE ✅
No blockers requiring immediate Dispatch Agent action.

### Recommended Follow-up Actions (Human)
1. **Review Decision Threads:** 335 pending threads need human decisions
   - Access PM Dashboard at http://localhost:3456
   - Review findings and make implementation decisions
   - Dispatch Agent will create tickets once decisions are made

2. **Monitor for Future Blockers:**
   - Dev agents may create blockers as they complete work
   - QA agents may identify tooling gaps or test failures
   - CI pipeline may create regression blockers

---

## Next Dispatch Run Triggers

The Dispatch Agent should run again when:
- A new blocker file appears in `docs/agent-output/blocked/`
- A tooling ticket is merged (check re-queue for tickets to re-test)
- Human makes decisions in pending threads (run Task 3 to create tickets)
- Scheduled periodic check (e.g., every 4-6 hours)

---

## Workflow State: HEALTHY ✅

The Digital Greeter agent workflow is in a healthy state:
- No blockers pending
- No tooling gaps blocking QA
- No inbox items requiring human intervention
- Decision threads awaiting standard human review process

**Self-Healing Loop:** Active and ready to process future tooling gaps automatically.
