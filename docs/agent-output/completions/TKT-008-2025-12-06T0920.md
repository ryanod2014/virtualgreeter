# Completion Report: TKT-008

### Summary
Fixed contradictions in the uptime monitoring documentation by updating all monitor configurations to use 3-minute check frequency (free tier) instead of 1-minute checks (paid tier). Added notes throughout the document to clarify this is the free tier limit.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "All monitor configs show 3-minute check frequency" | ✅ | Read updated doc - all monitors (Dashboard, Signaling Server, WebSocket, Supabase, Widget) now show "3 minutes" or "3 min" |
| "Doc clearly states this is the free tier limit" | ✅ | Added notes after summary table and after each monitor configuration explaining "3-minute check frequency is the free tier limit" |
| "No contradictions between tier description and config" | ✅ | Verified intro states "Free tier: 10 monitors, 3-minute intervals" (line 35) now matches all config examples |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| "Documentation only - no production risk" | ✅ | Only modified documentation file, no code changes |
| "3-minute checks still adequate for uptime monitoring" | ✅ | Followed existing patterns - kept 3-minute frequency already used for Supabase and Widget monitors |

### Files Changed
| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `docs/features/monitoring/UPTIME_MONITORING.md` | Updated table summary (lines 25-30) to show 3-min for all services with note. Updated Monitor 1 config (line 70) from 1min to 3min with note. Updated Monitor 2 config (line 89) from 1min to 3min with note. Updated Monitor 3 config (line 121) from 1min to 3min with note. |

### Documentation Impact
**REQUIRED:** List ALL feature docs that may need updating based on your changes.

| Feature Doc | Why It Needs Update |
|-------------|---------------------|
| None | This change updates the documentation itself to fix contradictions - no other docs affected |

If no docs affected, write: "None - no user-facing behavior changes"

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent
> The doc agent will read actual code changes, not trust this summary.
> This section helps PM triage which docs to re-document.

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-008`
**Key commits:**
- `14862be` - TKT-008: Fix uptime monitoring doc to use free tier settings

**Files changed (for git diff):**
- `docs/features/monitoring/UPTIME_MONITORING.md`

### UI Changes (if applicable)
N/A - Documentation only

### How to Test
1. Open `docs/features/monitoring/UPTIME_MONITORING.md`
2. Check line 25-28: All monitors show "3 min" frequency
3. Check line 30: Note explains free tier limit and upgrade cost
4. Check line 70: Monitor 1 config shows "Check Frequency: 3 minutes"
5. Check line 81: Note explains free tier limit
6. Check line 89: Monitor 2 config shows "Check Frequency: 3 minutes"
7. Check line 103: Note explains free tier limit
8. Check line 121: Monitor 3 config shows "Check Frequency: 3 minutes"
9. Check line 125: Note explains free tier limit
10. Verify no contradictions exist between free tier description (line 35) and any config examples

### Findings Reported
**⚠️ REQUIRED:** If you noticed ANY issues outside your scope, you MUST have written them to `docs/agent-output/findings/`. List them here:

- [x] I wrote findings files for all issues I noticed (or there were none)

| Finding ID | File Written | Title |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| F-DEV-TKT-008-1 | `docs/agent-output/findings/F-DEV-TKT-008-2025-12-06T0920.json` | Pre-existing test failures in typecheck and build |

### Notes
- The ticket specified running `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build`, which both showed pre-existing errors in test files (widget and server packages)
- These errors are unrelated to the documentation changes and existed before this ticket
- The errors are in test files for features like WebRTC, billing, health checks, etc.
- Since this is a documentation-only change with no production risk, these pre-existing test errors should not block completion
- Created a findings report documenting these pre-existing issues for the PM to address separately
