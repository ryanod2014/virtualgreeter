# Completion Report: TKT-064

### Summary
TKT-064 remains BLOCKED. Previous agent correctly identified that this ticket was generated from a human request for explanation ("explain this to me"), not an implementation request. The ticket lacks all required implementation details per SOP section 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation. No resolution has been provided, and no v2 ticket exists.

### Status: BLOCKED (Confirmed)

**Blocker File:** `docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-TKT-064-2025-12-06T0230.json`
**Committed:** 1b86764 (2025-12-06T02:18:20Z)

### Pre-Flight Validation Results

| Required Element | Status | Issue |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Clear goal | ❌ | Goal is unclear - ticket says "explain this to me" |
| Files to modify | ❌ | Empty array - no files specified |
| Acceptance criteria | ❌ | Not testable - "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" |
| Risks to avoid | ⚠️ | Generic only - "(Low risk) Follow existing patterns" |
| How to test | ❌ | No test steps provided |

**Conclusion:** Ticket fails validation per SOP 1.2. Cannot proceed to implementation.

### Background Context

**Finding F-022:** "URL Filter is Client-Side Only"
- **Issue:** URL filtering in call logs only works on already-fetched data (~500 calls max)
- **Suggested Fix:** Move URL filtering to server-side query
- **Human Decision:** "explain this to me" (requested explanation, not implementation)
- **System Response:** Provided explanation, suggested linking with F-021 (pagination)

**Ticket Generation Error:**
The ticket was auto-generated from a "custom response" decision type where the human only requested clarification. The fix_required field contains ["Custom response", "Note: explain this to me"] which is not an implementation specification.

### Previous Agent's Blocker (Confirmed Valid)

The previous agent provided three resolution options:

1. **Convert to Proper Implementation Ticket** (Recommended)
   - Research call logs implementation
   - Identify specific files (likely dashboard query/filter code)
   - Provide proper spec: files, server-side filtering approach, testable acceptance criteria

2. **Close as Invalid Ticket**
   - Mark invalid since human only wanted explanation (which was provided)
   - Keep F-022 in findings for future prioritization

3. **Block Pending Human Clarification**
   - Ask human directly if they want implementation or if explanation was sufficient
   - Route to option 1 or 2 based on response

### Current State

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-064`
**Last Commit:** 1b86764 - "BLOCKED TKT-064: Ticket missing implementation details - appears to be explanation-only"

**Work Done:**
- Previous agent: Read SOP, validated ticket, investigated F-022, created blocker file
- Current agent: Confirmed blocker remains valid, no changes to ticket

**No code changes made** - blocking validation prevents any implementation work.

### What PM Needs to Do

Choose one of the three options from the blocker file:

**If implementing the fix:**
1. Research call logs feature (likely in dashboard)
2. Identify files to modify (query/filter components)
3. Create TKT-064-v2 with:
   - Specific file paths
   - Implementation approach (add URL param to server-side query)
   - Testable acceptance criteria ("Can filter calls by URL when >500 calls exist")
   - Integration notes with F-021 if implementing pagination together

**If closing as invalid:**
1. Archive this ticket
2. Mark F-022 as "explained" or "deferred" in findings
3. Remove ticket reference from F-022

**If seeking clarification:**
1. Present to human: "F-022 explained URL filtering limitation. Do you want this implemented?"
2. Route based on response

### Files Changed
None - ticket blocked before any code modifications.

### Documentation Impact
None - no user-facing behavior changes.

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent
Not applicable - no implementation completed.

### UI Changes
None.

### How to Test
Cannot test - no implementation completed due to blocker.

### Findings Reported
None - no new issues noticed. The issue with this ticket itself was already documented in the existing blocker file.

### Notes

**Why this happened:** The ticket generation system appears to create tickets for all decision types, including "custom response" decisions that are just human questions. The system should probably skip ticket generation when:
- Decision option_id is "custom"
- Custom_note is a question (contains "?" or starts with "explain", "what", "why", "how")
- No fix_required items beyond "Custom response"

**For PM consideration:** F-022 and F-021 (pagination) are related. The system response suggested "Usually implemented together with F-021 (pagination). Want to add this to the pagination ticket or handle separately?" Consider combining these if both will be implemented.

**Session Info:** This is a continuation session where previous agent already blocked. No new information or ticket updates were available, so I confirmed the existing blocker and documented the current state for PM action.
