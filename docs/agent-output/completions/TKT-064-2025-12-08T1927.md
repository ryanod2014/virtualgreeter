# Completion Report: TKT-064 (Fourth Blocker Confirmation)

### Summary
TKT-064 remains BLOCKED for the fourth consecutive attempt. The ticket was generated from a human "explain this to me" request and lacks all required implementation details per SOP section 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation. No resolution or ticket updates have been provided since the original blocker was filed.

### Status: BLOCKED (Fourth Confirmation)

**Original Blocker:** `docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-TKT-064-2025-12-06T0230.json`
**Previous Completions:**
- 2025-12-08T0735.md - Second blocker confirmation
- 2025-12-08T0815.md - Third blocker confirmation (referenced in dev-status.json)
- 2025-12-08T1927.md - Fourth blocker confirmation (this report)

### Pre-Flight Validation Results

| Required Element | Status | Issue |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Clear goal | ❌ | "explain this to me" is not an implementation goal |
| Files to modify | ❌ | Empty array - no files specified |
| Acceptance criteria | ❌ | Not testable - "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" |
| Risks to avoid | ⚠️ | Generic only - "(Low risk) Follow existing patterns" |
| How to test | ❌ | No test steps provided |

**Conclusion:** Ticket fails validation per SOP 1.2. Cannot proceed to implementation.

### Systemic Issue Identified

**Problem:** This ticket has been blocked and re-assigned FOUR times without resolution:
1. First blocker: 2025-12-06T0230 - Original agent identified issue
2. Second attempt: 2025-12-08T0735 - Confirmed blocker remains
3. Third attempt: 2025-12-08T0815 - Confirmed blocker remains (marked in dev-status.json)
4. Fourth attempt: 2025-12-08T1927 - Confirmed blocker remains (this session)

**Root Cause:** The PM routing system continues to assign agents to TKT-064 despite the ticket being marked as "blocked" in dev-status.json and having an active blocker file.

**Impact:** Agent time is being wasted on repeated blocker confirmations rather than productive work.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

Cannot verify - no testable acceptance criteria provided in ticket.

| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" | ❌ | Cannot test - criterion is not specific or measurable |
| "Change is tested and verified" | ❌ | Cannot test - no implementation to verify |

### Risk Avoidance Verification

Cannot verify - ticket provides no specific risks, only generic "(Low risk) Follow existing patterns" guidance.

### Files Changed

None - ticket blocked before any code modifications (fourth consecutive time).

### Documentation Impact

None - no user-facing behavior changes.

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent

Not applicable - no implementation completed.

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-064`
**Current HEAD:** ea2be8d - "TKT-064: Third blocker confirmation - ticket still lacks implementation details"

No new commits in this session - no changes to make.

### UI Changes

None.

### How to Test

Cannot test - no implementation completed due to blocker.

### Findings Reported

None - the blocker issue was already documented in the original blocker file.

### Recommendation for PM

**URGENT: Stop assigning agents to TKT-064 until resolved.**

Three options remain (from original blocker):

**Option 1: Convert to Proper Implementation Ticket** (Recommended)
- Research call logs implementation in codebase
- Identify specific files to modify (likely dashboard query/filter code)
- Create TKT-064-v2 with:
  - Specific file paths
  - Implementation approach (add URL param to server-side query)
  - Testable acceptance criteria ("Can filter calls by URL when >500 calls exist")
  - May want to combine with F-021 (pagination) as system suggested

**Option 2: Close as Invalid Ticket**
- Archive TKT-064
- Mark F-022 as "explained" or "deferred" in findings
- Human received explanation they requested

**Option 3: Escalate to Human**
- Present to human: "F-022 explains URL filtering limitation. Do you want this implemented or was the explanation sufficient?"
- Route based on response

### Process Improvement Suggestion

**For PM System:** Add logic to prevent re-assigning tickets with status "blocked" in dev-status.json unless:
1. A continuation ticket (v2+) has been created, OR
2. The blocker has been resolved (marked "resolved" in blocker file), OR
3. Sufficient time has passed for human review (e.g., 24+ hours)

Current behavior wastes agent resources on repeated blocker confirmations.

### Notes

**Why this keeps happening:** The ticket is in `docs/prompts/active/` but has a blocker file and "blocked" status in dev-status.json. The PM routing logic appears to ignore these signals and continues assigning new agents.

**Background:** F-022 identified that URL filtering in call logs is client-side only (limited to ~500 fetched calls). The suggested fix is to move filtering to server-side query. However, the human response was "explain this to me" (a question), not "implement this" (an action request). The ticket generation system created an implementation ticket from an explanation request, resulting in an unimplementable spec.

**This is the fourth agent session on this ticket with identical outcomes.** No further value can be extracted until the underlying issue is resolved by PM or ticket author.
