# ESCALATION REPORT: TKT-064 - PM Routing Bug

## Status: BLOCKED (7th Confirmation)

### Critical Issue

**TKT-064 has been blocked SEVEN times** by dev agents for the same reason: **this is not an implementation ticket**.

### Root Cause

This is a **PM routing bug**. The ticket was generated from finding F-022 where the human decision was:
- Decision: "explain this to me"
- Fix required: ["Custom response", "Note: explain this to me"]

This was a request for **explanation**, not **implementation**. The human already received their explanation through the decision system.

### Why Dev Agents Block

According to the Dev Agent SOP section 1.2 (Pre-Flight Validation), tickets MUST have:

| Required | TKT-064 Status | Result |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| ✅ Clear goal | ❌ Just says "Custom response" | FAIL |
| ✅ Files to modify | ❌ Empty list: `[]` | FAIL |
| ✅ Acceptance criteria | ❌ Non-testable: "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" | FAIL |
| ✅ Risks to avoid | ❌ Vague: "(Low risk)" | FAIL |
| ✅ How to test | ❌ Not specified | FAIL |

**Result:** Ticket fails pre-flight validation. Cannot proceed with implementation.

### Evidence of Repeated Blocking

```
dc997cb - TKT-064: Sixth blocker confirmation - CRITICAL PM routing bug
9de4340 - TKT-064: Fifth blocker confirmation - CRITICAL PM routing bug
a6ef7ee - TKT-064: Fourth blocker confirmation - ticket still lacks implementation details
ea2be8d - TKT-064: Third blocker confirmation - ticket still lacks implementation details
fa926cf - TKT-064: Update dev-status.json with blocked completion
0d600f0 - TKT-064: Confirm blocker - ticket still missing implementation details
1b86764 - BLOCKED TKT-064: Ticket missing implementation details - appears to be explanation-only
5cfd1d4 - TKT-064: Seventh blocker confirmation - PM routing bug persists after 6 previous blocks (CURRENT)
```

### Resource Waste

**7 dev agent sessions wasted** - each one reading the SOP, reading the ticket, confirming it's invalid, writing a blocker, and being re-routed to the same broken ticket.

### The PM Bug

The PM retry loop is broken. It's not checking for blocker files before re-routing tickets to new dev agents. After the first blocker was filed, no additional dev agents should have been launched.

### Recommended Resolution

**Option 1 (Recommended): Close ticket as invalid**
- The human got their explanation (what they requested)
- Finding F-022 remains in findings for future prioritization
- If implementation is desired later, create a NEW ticket with proper research

**Option 2: Convert to proper implementation ticket**
- Requires PM investigation and codebase research
- Must identify: files to modify, server-side filtering approach, testable acceptance criteria
- Essentially creates a new ticket (not a continuation)

**Option 3: Fix PM routing logic**
- PM must check blocker files before re-launching agents
- PM must distinguish between "explanation request" and "implementation request"
- PM must not route explanation-only tickets to dev agents

### Next Steps for Human

1. **Fix PM routing logic** to prevent this from happening again
2. **Close TKT-064** as invalid (human got explanation, not implementation)
3. **Archive blocker files** for this ticket
4. If implementation is actually desired:
   - Create NEW ticket (not continuation)
   - Research call logs codebase first
   - Provide proper implementation specs (files, approach, testable criteria)
