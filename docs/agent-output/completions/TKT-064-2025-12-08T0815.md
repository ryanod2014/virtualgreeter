# Completion Report: TKT-064

### Summary
TKT-064 remains BLOCKED. Ticket fails SOP 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation due to missing implementation details. This is the third agent session confirming the same blocker - no resolution or v2 ticket has been provided.

### Status: BLOCKED (Confirmed - 3rd Session)

**Original Blocker:** `docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-TKT-064-2025-12-06T0230.json`
**First Confirmation:** `docs/agent-output/completions/TKT-064-2025-12-08T0735.md`
**This Session:** Confirming blocker remains active

### Pre-Flight Validation Results

| Required Element | Status | Issue |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Clear goal | ❌ | Goal says "explain this to me" - not implementation |
| Files to modify | ❌ | Shows "(see ticket for files)" - no files specified |
| Acceptance criteria | ❌ | "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" - not testable |
| Risks to avoid | ⚠️ | Generic only - "(Low risk) Follow existing patterns" |
| How to test | ❌ | No test steps provided |

**Per SOP 1.2:** "If ANY is missing or unclear → Report BLOCKED with question asking for clarification."

**Conclusion:** Cannot proceed to implementation phase. Ticket requires PM action per original blocker options.

### Ticket Background

**Source:** Finding F-022 - "URL Filter is Client-Side Only"
**Human Decision:** "explain this to me" (requested explanation, not implementation)
**Issue:** Ticket was auto-generated from a "custom response" decision where human only wanted clarification

### Original Blocker Options (From First Agent)

1. **Convert to Proper Implementation Ticket** (Recommended)
   - Research call logs to identify specific files
   - Create proper spec with files, approach, testable criteria

2. **Close as Invalid Ticket**
   - Mark invalid since human only requested explanation
   - Keep F-022 in findings for future prioritization

3. **Ask Human for Clarification**
   - Confirm whether implementation is desired or explanation was sufficient

### Session Summary

**What I Did:**
1. Read SOP and ticket spec
2. Reviewed previous blocker and completion reports
3. Confirmed ticket remains unchanged
4. Verified blocker is still valid per SOP requirements
5. Writing this completion report to document third confirmation

**What I Did NOT Do:**
- No code changes (blocking validation prevents implementation)
- No commits (nothing to commit)
- No new blocker file (existing blocker still valid)

### Files Changed
None - ticket blocked before any code modifications.

### Documentation Impact
None - no user-facing behavior changes.

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent
**Branch:** `agent/tkt-064`
**Last Commit:** fa926cf - "TKT-064: Update dev-status.json with blocked completion"
**Status:** Clean working directory, no changes made this session

### UI Changes
None.

### How to Test
Cannot test - no implementation completed due to blocker.

### Findings Reported
None - no new issues noticed. The ticket validation issue was already documented in the existing blocker file.

### Notes

**Recommendation for PM:** This ticket has now been blocked by three separate agent sessions. To resolve:

- **Either:** Create TKT-064-v2 with proper implementation details (specific files, implementation steps, testable criteria)
- **Or:** Close this ticket as invalid and handle F-022 through proper discovery/planning process
- **Or:** Ask human if they want F-022 implemented (the explanation was already provided in the decision system)

**Related Finding:** F-022 mentions this issue is related to F-021 (pagination). System suggested implementing together. Consider combining if both will be implemented.

**Process Improvement Note:** The ticket generation system should not create implementation tickets for "custom response" decisions that are questions/explanation requests. Suggest adding validation to skip ticket generation when decision is just seeking clarification.
