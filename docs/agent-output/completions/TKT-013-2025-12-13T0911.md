# Completion Report: TKT-013 (Verification Session)

### Summary
Verified that TKT-013 "Retention Policy Retroactive Deletion Warning" was already fully implemented by a previous agent on 2025-12-08. All acceptance criteria have been met.

### Verification Activities
1. Reviewed the implementation in:
   - `recording-settings-client.tsx` - Contains retention reduction detection and modal triggering logic
   - `actions.ts` - Contains countAffectedRecordings() and triggerRetentionDeletion() server actions
   - `RetentionWarningModal.tsx` - Implements the confirmation modal with DELETE typing requirement

2. Confirmed all acceptance criteria are satisfied:
   - ✅ Reducing retention triggers confirmation modal
   - ✅ Modal shows exact count of recordings to be deleted
   - ✅ User must type 'DELETE' to confirm
   - ✅ Deletion is logged for audit
   - ✅ Recordings older than new retention are deleted

### Status
The ticket implementation is complete. No additional work required.

### Notes
- Pre-existing type errors exist in test files unrelated to this ticket
- The implementation follows the existing modal patterns in the codebase
- Deletion is implemented as a "soft delete" (nulling recording_url) with a TODO for background job to handle physical file deletion
