# Completion Report: TKT-064 (Fifth Blocker Confirmation)

### Summary
TKT-064 remains BLOCKED for the fifth consecutive attempt. The ticket was generated from a human "explain this to me" request and lacks all required implementation details per SOP section 1.2 Pre-Flight Validation. No resolution or ticket updates have been provided since the original blocker was filed on 2025-12-06.

### Status: BLOCKED (Fifth Confirmation)

**Original Blocker:** `docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-TKT-064-2025-12-06T0230.json`
**Previous Completions:**
- 2025-12-08T0735.md - Second blocker confirmation
- 2025-12-08T0815.md - Third blocker confirmation
- 2025-12-08T1927.md - Fourth blocker confirmation (marked in dev-status.json with URGENT note)
- 2025-12-11T0959.md - Fifth blocker confirmation (this report)

### Pre-Flight Validation Results

| Required Element | Status | Issue |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Clear goal | ❌ | "explain this to me" is not an implementation goal |
| Files to modify | ❌ | Empty array - "(see ticket for files)" placeholder only |
| Acceptance criteria | ❌ | Not testable - "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" |
| Risks to avoid | ⚠️ | Generic only - "(Low risk) Follow existing patterns" |
| How to test | ❌ | No test steps provided |

**Conclusion:** Ticket fails validation per SOP 1.2. Cannot proceed to implementation.

### Critical PM System Issue

**Problem:** This ticket has been blocked and re-assigned FIVE times without resolution:
1. First blocker: 2025-12-06T0230 - Original agent identified issue
2. Second attempt: 2025-12-08T0735 - Confirmed blocker remains
3. Third attempt: 2025-12-08T0815 - Confirmed blocker remains
4. Fourth attempt: 2025-12-08T1927 - Confirmed blocker remains, added URGENT note to dev-status.json
5. Fifth attempt: 2025-12-11T0959 - Confirmed blocker remains (this session)

**Root Cause:** The PM routing system continues to assign agents to TKT-064 despite:
- Ticket being marked as "blocked" with status in dev-status.json
- Having an active blocker file in docs/agent-output/blocked/
- Fourth completion report explicitly stating "URGENT: Stop assigning agents to this ticket"

**Impact:** Five agent sessions have been wasted on repeated blocker confirmations. This represents significant resource waste and indicates a systemic issue with the PM agent routing logic.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

Cannot verify - no testable acceptance criteria provided in ticket.

| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Issue described in F-022 is resolved" | ❌ | Cannot test - criterion is not specific or measurable |
| "Change is tested and verified" | ❌ | Cannot test - no implementation to verify |

### Risk Avoidance Verification

Cannot verify - ticket provides no specific risks, only generic "(Low risk) Follow existing patterns" guidance.

### Files Changed

None - ticket blocked before any code modifications (fifth consecutive time).

### Documentation Impact

None - no user-facing behavior changes.

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent

Not applicable - no implementation completed.

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-064`
**Current HEAD:** a6ef7ee - "TKT-064: Fourth blocker confirmation - ticket still lacks implementation details"

No new commits in this session - no changes to make.

### UI Changes

None.

### How to Test

Cannot test - no implementation completed due to blocker.

### Findings Reported

None - the blocker issue was already documented in the original blocker file.

### Recommendation for PM

**CRITICAL: IMMEDIATELY stop assigning agents to TKT-064 until resolved.**

This is now the fifth wasted agent session. The PM routing system MUST be updated to:
1. Check for active blocker files before assigning tickets
2. Respect the "blocked" status in dev-status.json
3. Not re-assign tickets with unresolved blockers

Three resolution options remain (from original blocker):

**Option 1: Convert to Proper Implementation Ticket** (Recommended)
- Research call logs implementation in codebase
- Identify specific files to modify (likely dashboard query/filter code)
- Create TKT-064-v2 with:
  - Specific file paths
  - Implementation approach (add URL param to server-side query)
  - Testable acceptance criteria ("Can filter calls by URL when >500 calls exist")
  - May want to combine with F-021 (pagination) as system suggested

**Option 2: Close as Invalid Ticket**
- Archive TKT-064
- Mark F-022 as "explained" or "deferred" in findings
- Human received explanation they requested

**Option 3: Escalate to Human**
- Present to human: "F-022 explains URL filtering limitation. Do you want this implemented or was the explanation sufficient?"
- Route based on response

### Process Improvement Required

**For PM System - CRITICAL BUG:**

The PM agent routing logic has a critical bug that ignores blocker signals. It must be updated to:

1. **Before assigning any ticket**, check:
   ```
   - Does docs/agent-output/blocked/BLOCKED-{ticket-id}-*.json exist?
   - Does dev-status.json show status: "blocked" for this ticket?
   - If YES to either → DO NOT ASSIGN
   ```

2. **Tickets can only be re-assigned if:**
   - A continuation ticket (v2+) has been created with blocker resolution, OR
   - The blocker file has been resolved/archived, OR
   - Human explicitly overrides the block

3. **Alert PM operator** when blockers exceed 24 hours without resolution

Current behavior is causing systematic waste of agent resources.

### Notes

**Why this keeps happening:** The ticket is in `docs/prompts/active/` but has a blocker file and "blocked" status in dev-status.json. The PM routing logic appears to completely ignore these signals and continues assigning new agents.

**Background:** F-022 identified that URL filtering in call logs is client-side only (limited to ~500 fetched calls). The suggested fix is to move filtering to server-side query. However, the human response was "explain this to me" (a question), not "implement this" (an action request). The ticket generation system created an implementation ticket from an explanation request, resulting in an unimplementable spec.

**This is the fifth agent session on this ticket with identical outcomes.** This represents a critical system failure. No further value can be extracted until:
1. The PM routing bug is fixed, AND
2. Either the ticket is properly specified or closed as invalid

**Recommendation:** After filing this report, the PM system operator should:
1. Immediately remove TKT-064 from the active ticket queue
2. Fix the PM routing logic to respect blocker files
3. Review if similar issues exist with other tickets
