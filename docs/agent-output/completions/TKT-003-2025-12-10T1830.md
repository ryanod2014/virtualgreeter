# Completion Report: TKT-003 (Duplicate Assignment #2)

### Summary
TKT-003 was already completed, QA approved, and merged to main on 2025-12-05. This is a duplicate assignment (second duplicate). No new work was required.

### Status: Already Complete

**Original completion:** `docs/agent-output/completions/TKT-003-2025-12-05T1935.md`
**First duplicate:** `docs/agent-output/completions/TKT-003-2025-12-08T0929.md`
**Implementation commit:** `75f555b` - TKT-003: Update cancel modal copy with 30-day data retention language
**Merge commit:** `9fe2764` - Merge agent/TKT-003-cancel-copy - TKT-003 QA approved
**Branch:** `agent/TKT-003-cancel-copy`

### Verification of Existing Work

I verified the following:

1. **Code changes are in place:** The cancel modal at `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/settings/billing/cancel-subscription-modal.tsx` line 478 contains the correct copy:
   ```
   Your data will be retained for 30 days after cancellation, then may be permanently deleted.
   ```

2. **All acceptance criteria met:**
   - ✅ Cancel modal shows updated retention language
   - ✅ No mention of "immediate" or "permanent" deletion without context
   - ✅ Modal text matches exact copy specified in ticket

3. **Changes merged to main:** Commit `75f555b` is present in main branch
4. **Completion documented:** Two previous reports exist
5. **Dev status updated:** TKT-003 is already listed in `docs/data/dev-status.json` completed array

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Cancel modal shows updated retention language" | ✅ Already Complete | Code review confirms correct copy at line 478 |
| "No mention of 'immediate' or 'permanent' deletion without context" | ✅ Already Complete | Grep search confirms only contextual mention |
| "Modal text matches exact copy" | ✅ Already Complete | Exact match confirmed: "Your data will be retained for 30 days after cancellation, then may be permanently deleted." |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| "Copy change only" | ✅ | Previous implementation only changed text (no logic changes) |
| "Terms of service mismatch" | ✅ | Exact copy was used as specified |

### Files Changed
No files changed in this session - work was already complete and merged.
