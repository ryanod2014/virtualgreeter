# Completion Report: TKT-003 (Duplicate Assignment)

### Summary
TKT-003 was already completed, QA approved, and merged to main on 2025-12-05. This is a duplicate assignment. No new work was required.

### Status: Already Complete

**Previous completion:** `docs/agent-output/completions/TKT-003-2025-12-05T1935.md`
**Implementation commit:** `75f555b` - TKT-003: Update cancel modal copy with 30-day data retention language
**Merge commit:** `9fe2764` - Merge agent/TKT-003-cancel-copy - TKT-003 QA approved
**Branch:** `agent/TKT-003-cancel-copy`

### Verification of Existing Work

I verified the following:

1. **Code changes are in place:** The cancel modal at `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/settings/billing/cancel-subscription-modal.tsx` lines 474-509 contains the correct copy:
   - Heading: "Data Retention Notice" (not "permanently delete your data")
   - Body: "Your data will be retained for 30 days after cancellation, then may be permanently deleted."
   - Warning: "You can resubscribe within 30 days to retain your data" (not "Data deletion begins immediately")

2. **All acceptance criteria met:**
   - ✅ Cancel modal shows updated retention language
   - ✅ No mention of "immediate" or "permanent" deletion without context
   - ✅ Modal text matches exact copy specified in ticket

3. **Changes merged to main:** Commit `75f555b` is present in main branch
4. **Completion documented:** Report exists at `docs/agent-output/completions/TKT-003-2025-12-05T1935.md`
5. **Dev status updated:** TKT-003 is listed in `docs/data/dev-status.json` completed array

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Cancel modal shows updated retention language" | ✅ Already Complete | Code review shows correct copy at line 478 |
| "No mention of 'immediate' or 'permanent' deletion without context" | ✅ Already Complete | Removed in commit 75f555b |
| "Modal text matches exact copy" | ✅ Already Complete | Exact match confirmed |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| "Copy change only" | ✅ | Previous implementation only changed text |
| "Terms of service mismatch" | ✅ | Exact copy was used |

### Files Changed
No files changed in this session - work was already complete.

### Documentation Impact
**Already addressed in previous completion:** Feature doc `docs/features/billing/cancel-subscription.md` was identified as needing updates (color scheme change, language updates).

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent

### Findings Reported

- [x] I wrote findings files for all issues I noticed (or there were none)

None - no issues noticed. The work was already completed successfully.

### Notes
- This appears to be a duplicate ticket assignment
- The branch `agent/TKT-003-cancel-copy` already exists and contains the completed work
- All acceptance criteria are met in the current code
- The ticket may have been re-assigned accidentally or the PM system may have launched this task without checking completion status
- No new commits were made in this session since the work was already done
- Session ID: 412bb9b0-90ee-479a-b244-b4cb409154bb
