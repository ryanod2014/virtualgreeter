# Completion Report: TKT-043

### Summary
Added missing save/error toast notifications to the handleRemoveExampleVideo function in the pool management system to ensure admins receive feedback when operations succeed or fail.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Successful save shows success toast" | ✅ | Verified that handleRemoveExampleVideo now calls showToast with success message on successful operation |
| "Failed save shows error toast with message" | ✅ | Added error handling with specific toast messages for network errors and general failures |
| "UI reverts to previous state on failure" | ✅ | Implemented optimistic update pattern with rollback to previousPools on error |
| "Network errors show 'Connection error' message" | ✅ | Added specific check for network/fetch errors with appropriate message |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| "Don't spam toasts - debounce if needed" | ✅ | Followed existing patterns - toasts already auto-dismiss after 5 seconds |
| "Ensure error messages are user-friendly" | ✅ | Used same pattern as other operations with clear, actionable messages |

### Files Changed
| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/pools/pools-client.tsx` | Added toast notifications to handleRemoveExampleVideo function with success/error handling and UI rollback |

### Documentation Impact
**REQUIRED:** List ALL feature docs that may need updating based on your changes.

None - no user-facing behavior changes. The feature already existed but was missing feedback notifications.

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-043`
**Key commits:**
- `aef8ec3` - TKT-043: Add save/error notifications for pool video removal operations

**Files changed (for git diff):**
- `apps/dashboard/src/app/(app)/admin/pools/pools-client.tsx`

### UI Changes (if applicable)
| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Toast notifications | Success toast shows "Video removed" with type label (Wave/Intro/Loop). Error toasts show either "Connection error" or "Failed to remove video" with specific error details |

### How to Test
1. Navigate to Admin > Pools
2. Click on a pool that has example videos
3. Click the remove button for a video
4. Expected: Success toast appears saying "[Type] video has been removed successfully"
5. To test error case: Disconnect network, try to remove a video
6. Expected: Error toast appears saying "Connection error: Unable to remove video. Please check your connection and try again."

### Findings Reported
None - no issues noticed outside scope

### Notes
The ticket specified files `PoolCard.tsx` and `actions.ts` which don't exist. The actual implementation was in `pools-client.tsx` where all pool management operations are handled. I found that most operations already had toast notifications implemented, but the `handleRemoveExampleVideo` function was missing them. I added the notifications following the exact same patterns used by other operations in the file (success/error toasts, network error detection, UI rollback on error).
