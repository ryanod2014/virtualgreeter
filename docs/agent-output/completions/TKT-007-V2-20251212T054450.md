# Completion Report: TKT-007-V2

### Summary
Verified TKT-007-V2 documentation work is complete. The Public Feedback feature documentation has been successfully updated to accurately describe it as a "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting" system for authenticated dashboard users, removing all misleading references to visitors and post-call feedback.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Feature doc accurately describes the voting/feedback system" | ✅ | Read the updated documentation at docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md - title changed to "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting (V6)", description clarifies it's for authenticated users, explains cross-org visibility vs public access |
| "No mention of 'visitors' or 'post-call' in context of feedback" | ✅ | Reviewed entire documentation - "visitors" only appears in "Affected Users" section to explicitly state visitors do NOT interact with this feature. No "post-call" references exist |
| "Clear that authentication is required" | ✅ | Documentation includes explicit note: "Authentication Required: This feature is only accessible to authenticated dashboard users (Agents, Admins, Platform Admins). Website visitors do not interact with this feature directly." |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| "Documentation only - no production risk" | ✅ | No code changes made, only documentation updated. Verified by checking git diff - only docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md changed |

### Files Changed
| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md` | Already updated in previous TKT-007 work - renamed feature to "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting", clarified authentication requirement, removed visitor/post-call references |

### Documentation Impact
None - no user-facing behavior changes, this ticket only fixes the documentation itself.

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent
Not applicable - this was a documentation fix ticket, not a feature implementation.

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-007-v2`
**Key commits:**
- `dfb30f5` - Add continuation prompt for TKT-007-V2

**Note:** The actual documentation work was completed on branch `agent/tkt-007-fix-public-feedback-doc` which has already been merged and QA approved. This continuation ticket was created due to a regression test script error (bash syntax issue with `${TICKET_ID,,}` substitution on macOS), not actual code problems.

### How to Test
1. Read docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md
2. Verify title is "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting"
3. Verify authentication requirement is clearly stated
4. Verify no misleading visitor/post-call references

### Findings Reported
✅ I wrote findings files for all issues I noticed

| Finding ID | File Written | Title |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| F-DEV-TKT-007-V2-1 | `docs/agent-output/findings/F-DEV-TKT-007-V2-20251212T054450.json` | Pre-existing merge conflicts in server code blocking builds |

**Critical Finding:** The main branch has unresolved merge conflicts in apps/server/src/features/signaling/socket-handlers.ts and related files, preventing `pnpm build` from succeeding. This is NOT related to TKT-007-V2 (documentation only) but blocks all development work. The conflicts appear to be from incomplete merges of branches tkt-005e and tkt-004d-paused-org-status.

### Notes

**Verification Approach:**
Per the continuation ticket instructions, I verified:
1. ✅ The previous TKT-007 work is complete - documentation properly describes the feature as a voting/feedback system for authenticated users
2. ✅ Ran `pnpm typecheck` - found pre-existing type error in apps/widget/src/features/webrtc/useWebRTC.test.ts (also exists in main branch)
3. ❌ Ran `pnpm build` - found pre-existing merge conflicts in server code (also exists in main branch, reported as critical finding)

**Regression Test Error Context:**
The original TKT-007 was marked as "REGRESSION-FAILED" with error:
```
/Users/ryanodonnell/projects/Digital_greeter/scripts/run-regression-tests.sh: line 63: agent/${TICKET_ID,,}: bad substitution
```

This is a bash syntax error in the regression test script itself (the `${VARIABLE,,}` lowercase syntax is not supported in macOS's default bash 3.x). It's NOT a problem with the TKT-007 code changes, which are documentation only.

**Recommendation:**
1. Approve and merge TKT-007-V2 - the documentation work is complete and correct
2. Address the critical finding: resolve merge conflicts in server code before any other tickets can build successfully
3. Fix the regression test script to use portable bash syntax (e.g., `$(echo "$TICKET_ID" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')` instead of `${TICKET_ID,,}`)
