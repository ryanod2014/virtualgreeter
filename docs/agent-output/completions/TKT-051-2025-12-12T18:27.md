# Completion Report: TKT-051 (Continuation - TypeScript Fix)

### Summary
Fixed TypeScript type error in the gzip compression implementation. This is a follow-up to the completed TKT-051 work that addresses a type strictness issue discovered during verification.

### Issue Found
During verification of the completed TKT-051 implementation, a TypeScript type error was found in `useCobrowse.ts:46`:
- Error: `Argument of type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'`
- Location: `String.fromCharCode(uint8Array[i])`
- Root cause: TypeScript's strictness assumes array access could return undefined

### Fix Applied
Added non-null assertion operator (`!`) to line 46 since Uint8Array indices are always defined within bounds when accessed within the array's length.

### Files Changed
| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `apps/widget/src/features/cobrowse/useCobrowse.ts` | Added non-null assertion on line 46: `uint8Array[i]!` |

### Git Context
**Branch:** `agent/tkt-051`
**Key commit:**
- `8a4619d` - TKT-051: Fix TypeScript type error in useCobrowse.ts

### Verification
- [x] TypeCheck passes for modified file
- [x] Changes committed and pushed to remote
- [x] No other type errors in modified files

### Notes
- This was the only type error in the files modified for TKT-051
- Other type errors in the codebase are pre-existing in test files (useCobrowse.test.ts, main.test.ts, Widget.test.tsx)
- The fix is minimal and doesn't change functionality - just adds type safety
