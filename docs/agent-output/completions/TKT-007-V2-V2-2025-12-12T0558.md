# Completion Report: TKT-007-V2-V2

### Summary
Verified completion of TKT-007-V2-V2 continuation ticket. The documentation work to fix the Public Feedback feature documentation was already completed and merged to main. This continuation was triggered by a false-positive regression test failure (shell script syntax error, not code issue). Confirmed documentation accurately describes the feature as "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting" for authenticated dashboard users, not post-call visitor feedback.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Feature doc accurately describes the voting/feedback system | ✅ | Reviewed docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md - correctly titled "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting (V6)", describes cross-organization voting system for authenticated users |
| No mention of 'visitors' or 'post-call' in context of feedback | ✅ | Searched documentation - "visitor" only appears in context of clarifying they DON'T have access (line 13: "Website visitors do not interact with this feature directly") |
| Clear that authentication is required | ✅ | Multiple sections confirm authentication requirement: lines 6-7 (naming note), line 13 (authentication required callout), line 20 (purpose section) |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| Documentation only - no production risk | ✅ | Only documentation file modified, no code changes |

### Files Changed
| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md` | Already completed and merged to main - verified content is correct |
| `docs/data/dev-status.json` | Added TKT-007-V2-V2 completion entry |
| `docs/agent-output/findings/F-DEV-TKT-007-V2-V2-2025-12-12T0558.json` | Documented pre-existing merge conflicts in server |
| `docs/agent-output/findings/F-DEV-TKT-007-V2-V2-2-2025-12-12T0558.json` | Documented pre-existing TypeScript errors in widget tests |

### Documentation Impact
None - this ticket WAS the documentation update. The work was already completed in a previous session and merged to main.

### Git Context for Re-Doc Agent
> The doc agent will read actual code changes, not trust this summary.
> This section helps PM triage which docs to re-document.

**Branch:** `agent/tkt-007-v2-v2`
**Key commits:**
- `ebeef4e` - Add continuation prompt for TKT-007-V2-V2 (only change on this branch vs main)

**Files changed (for git diff):**
- `docs/prompts/active/dev-agent-TKT-007-V2-V2-v1.md` (prompt file only)

The actual documentation work was completed in previous sessions and is already on main branch (commit 39d0765: "Merge agent/tkt-007-fix-public-feedback-doc - TKT-007 QA approved").

### How to Test
1. Read docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md
2. Verify title is "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting"
3. Verify description clarifies authenticated users only
4. Verify no misleading references to post-call visitor feedback

### Notes

**Context:** This is a continuation ticket following a regression test failure. However, investigation shows:

1. **Documentation work is complete**: The file `docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md` on main branch already contains all required changes:
   - Renamed to "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting"
   - Clarifies it's for authenticated dashboard users
   - Explains "public" means cross-organization visibility, not anonymous access
   - No mentions of "visitors" or "post-call" in incorrect context

2. **Regression test failure was false positive**: The error was a shell script syntax issue (`line 63: agent/${TICKET_ID,,}: bad substitution`), not actual code problems. This appears to be a bash version incompatibility with the `${var,,}` lowercase transformation syntax.

3. **Pre-existing build issues found**: Both `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build` fail due to issues unrelated to this ticket:
   - Merge conflict markers in `apps/server/src/features/signaling/socket-handlers.ts`
   - TypeScript syntax errors in `apps/widget/src/features/webrtc/useWebRTC.test.ts`
   - Git history shows TKT-104 likely fixed these on another branch

4. **My branch state**: Only 1 commit ahead of main with just the continuation prompt file - no source code changes needed or made.

**Recommendation**: The documentation work for TKT-007 is complete and verified. The regression test script should be fixed to use portable bash syntax (e.g., `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` instead of `${var,,}`). The pre-existing build issues should be addressed separately.
