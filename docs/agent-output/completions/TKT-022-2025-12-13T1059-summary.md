# Summary Report: TKT-022

### Status: ALREADY COMPLETE

TKT-022 was previously completed by another agent. This session verified the implementation.

### Summary
The seat limit enforcement (maximum 50 seats) was already implemented in commit `6a4251f`. The API properly rejects requests that would exceed 50 seats with a clear error message, while grandfathering existing organizations.

### Implementation Details
- **File Modified:** `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/billing/seats/route.ts` (lines 70-78)
- **Implementation:** Validates `action === "add" && newUsedSeats > MAX_SEAT_LIMIT`
- **Error Response:** Returns 400 status with message "Maximum seat limit is 50"
- **Grandfathering:** Only blocks adding seats; existing orgs over 50 can continue operating

### Verification Results
All acceptance criteria were met in the previous implementation:
1. ✅ API rejects seat count > 50 with 400 error
2. ✅ Clear error message: "Maximum seat limit is 50"
3. ✅ Existing orgs over 50 seats are grandfathered (validation only on "add" action)

### Build Status
- **TypeCheck:** Failed due to pre-existing errors in server package (unrelated to TKT-022)
- **Build:** Failed due to same pre-existing server package errors
- **Note:** These failures are documented and don't affect the TKT-022 implementation which is in the dashboard package

### Conclusion
No additional work was required. The ticket was already properly implemented and verified.
