# Completion Report: TKT-007

### Summary
Fixed the Public Feedback feature documentation to accurately describe it as a "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting" system for authenticated dashboard users, not a post-call visitor feedback form.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
| Criterion | Status | How Verified |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| "Feature doc accurately describes the voting/feedback system" | ✅ | Updated title to "Feature Request Voting & Bug Reporting" and expanded Quick Summary to clearly describe both feature requests and bug reports |
| "No mention of 'visitors' or 'post-call' in context of feedback" | ✅ | Removed confusing note about "post-call feedback form for visitors" and removed "Website Visitor" from Affected Users |
| "Clear that authentication is required" | ✅ | Added explicit "Authentication Required" note stating feature is only accessible to authenticated dashboard users |

### Risk Avoidance Verification
| Risk | Avoided? | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| "Documentation only - no production risk" | ✅ | Only modified the documentation file, no code changes |

### Files Changed
| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `docs/features/visitor/public-feedback.md` | Updated title, Quick Summary, Affected Users section, Purpose section, and User Goals table to accurately reflect authenticated user feature request system |

### Documentation Impact
**REQUIRED:** List ALL feature docs that may need updating based on your changes.

| Feature Doc | Why It Needs Update |
|-------------|---------------------|
| None - no other docs affected | This was a documentation fix only |
